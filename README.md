# PVP, Chi_Square, Player Segementation
* PVP is about Player vs Player analysis. There are three combinations found from **PVP analysis**.And all the combinations on the bar chart gave a weird result on the minute of 11. More details on the Question 1.
* Performing **statistical analysis** of the **categorical data** using **chi square test** on teens income vs education, number of teens in the house
* With the information from players likes and dislikes, applying unsupervised learning using UMAP and KMEANS to find vaarious multiple clusters finally tagging each player the list of top 3 game types**Deep Player segmentaion (unsupervised)**.
* Question 3 is about various **charts mistakes** and correction

# Starcraft 2
Attempt to solve the following problems with the provided dataset using Python (no restrictions on package usage):

1. Determine if this dataset needs any preprocessing. If so, clean the dataset and document your steps. If not, explain how you came to that conclusion.
2. Multicollinearity has a negative impact on many popular ML models. Check if this dataset experiences any multicollinearity. If so, reduce the impact until an acceptable point.
3. Determine what are the most important features that could help predict a player’s rank? Interpret your results for a general audience (coaching staff, pro players, etc).
4. Your team’s Starcraft2 coaching staff loved your project! They think this is perfect for scouting rising stars. Using your discoveries from (3), create a function to find players who should be given a chance to become professionals. Explain why your set of players make sense.
a. Hint: Don’t go overboard with complexity. More often than not, statistical reasoning is more efficient than taking an ML approach.
5. Hypothetically, if you were to move forward with creating a fully-fledged model to predict LeagueIndex, what model(s) would you consider and why? (Don’t actually implement anything!)
